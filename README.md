# Nisi_app

Nisi will be a social network where you'll be able to find posts from other social networks such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Each post is organised in your feed and each one could be rated.
Users will be able to find users who are near and follow them, follow a user in Nisi will mean follow all of his social networks as well.

Nisi is developed using vue js and even though was started with Ionic, components were replaced. In the android folder there is an Android Project folder which can be edited with android studio.

Nisi development was made following this tutorial:

where instructions for building and serving will be found.

This app is inspired by the Episode 01 Season 03 (Nosedive) from Black Mirror.
